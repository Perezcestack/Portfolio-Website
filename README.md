# Portfolio Suitcase Grid

Open `index.html` in your browser to view a centered 2x2 grid of suitcases. Hover a suitcase to animate its lid open and reveal the label. On touch devices, tap a suitcase to toggle open.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — layout and animations
- `script.js` — click/touch toggles

How to run:

1. Open the folder in your file manager.
2. Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari).

Optional: serve with a simple HTTP server for best results:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
